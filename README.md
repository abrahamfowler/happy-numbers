The App?
 
An educational for children aged 5-8 year old.
A mini mathematical game with different levels of difficulty.

Who the target audience is?

The target audience for this app are children aged between 5 and 8. 

How is the market reflected in the app?

As our target audience are children, large buttons would be required for easier navigation. The colour scheme would be light but still relates to the theme of the game. The app would have sounds to keep children entertained and engaged.
Once we had enough information from brainstorming we set about sketching our initial designs (please see documentation). We tried keep the design as simple as possible, with the layout just as tidy to make sure the app is user friendly. 
After sketching we started to programme our initial design. The questions used in the app have been referenced from BBC Bite size KS1 as they recommend it for Primary education pupils.
Before finishing the app we created a questionnaire (please see documentation) to allow us to see how our target audience responds and to receive feedback, positive or otherwise. At the same time we created several persona’s in order to get a broader understanding of our audience. 
This has helped us greatly as it puts our view of our app in a different light and lets us add or remove features to improve usability. 

What worked well?

We made the avatar animate when a question is answered correctly;
Added music on intro, end and sounds on button press;
Questions taken from KS1 BBC bite size, added difficulty levels for improvement;
Created a 'Hints' button for additional help in answering;
Mobile and desktop compatible;
Animated the buttons;
Introduced a storyline/objective – help bob get home;
There is encouraging feedback when question is answered;

What does not work well(i.e. Bugs, glitches etc..)?

Landscape view works but with a few glitches;
i.e. Buttons overflow containers, bad guy does not show correctly, display looks a bit squished.
Browser back button not working correctly;
Splash page same as background page (lack of variation);

Possible future add ons:

Examining the questionnaire we gave out and the persona’s we created we can list future features to make the app complete.
A score tracker, for the competitive children but also allows an individual to see how they are doing;
Additional maths (division and multiplication);
Improved animation and sprites;
Add background music that is relevant and not too distracting;
Should have added end summary and move achievements to unlock;
Use a larger testing group during the beta launch.
